There lived two trees, named Chintu and Pintu, who were brothers. 
        Chintu and Pintu had many friends like the rabbit and his brothers, the group of monkeys, the family of birds, the Bunky bear and the wise old wolf
        One day, all the friends were chatting. Suddenly Pintu saw a WOODCUTTER coming toward the forest. Pintu said “Hey look a WOODCUTTER is coming towards the forest! Run! Run!”chintu said to the animals. 
        But no one ran. They said “You give us food, shelter, you give us fresh air to breathe. How can we leave you in danger and go?” Chintu and Pintu thanked them.”OK you all hide behind us” said the two brother trees. 
        So the monkeys and the birds hid inside the leaves of the tree and the other animals hid behind the tree.Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit.
