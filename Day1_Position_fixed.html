    <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur, adipisicing elit. Maxime delectus rem ad possimus, consectetur vel, quaerat magnam consequatur suscipit, quia porro labore adipisci similique quas temporibus qui dolorem ipsa eius.Chintu and Pintu had many friends like the rabbit and his brothers, the group of monkeys, the family of birds, the Bunky bear and the wise old wolf
        One day, all the friends were chatting. Suddenly Pintu saw a WOODCUTTER coming toward the forest. Pintu said “Hey look a WOODCUTTER is coming towards the forest! Run! Run!”chintu said to the animals. 
        But no one ran. They said “You give us food, shelter, you give us fresh air to breathe. How can we leave you in danger and go?” Chintu and Pintu thanked them.”OK you all hide behind us” said the two brother trees. 
        So the monkeys and the birds hid inside the leaves of the tree and the other animals hid behind the tree.</p>

        <p>On one lovely evening, a young boy was laughing and playing in the garden. He was chasing butterflies as he ran across the beautiful flowers. He also saw a bulky cow who was trying to keep a bug away by swirling her tail. The boy saw different animals like frogs, fish, etc. 
            The child laughed and enjoyed the whole scene a lot. He then saw a small brown squirrel running here and there, he tried to follow it and reached a flower bed. It had beautiful red roses, 
            the boy tried to pick one flower but the thorns plugged his finger. He ran to his mother crying and told her about everything. Listening to this his mother explained that we must not put any sort of harm to nature instead we should help it to grow. 
            The boy learned a new lesson and was very happy.</p>
